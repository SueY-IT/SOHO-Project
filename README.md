<h1>SOHO Porject</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project utilizes Cisco Packet tracer to design a network that is independent from the company's main infrastructure. The network includes one Cisco router and one switch that supports three departments â€” Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception. Each department is assigned to separate VLANs and wireless access is provided for each department.
<br />


<h2>Core Components </h2>

- <b>Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.</b>
- <b>Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.</b>
- <b>Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers.</b>
- <b>Subnetting and IP Addressing.</b>
- <b>Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick).</b>
- <b>Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server).</b>
- <b>Configuring WLAN or wireless network (Cisco Access Point).</b>
- <b>Host Device Configurations.</b>
- <b>Test and Verifying Network Communication.</b>
